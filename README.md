- `BearView.swift` - Bear character with animations and interactions
- `SoundManager.swift` - Handles giggle sounds

## üé≠ Advanced Animations & Effects

### Particle System
- **Tickle Particles**: 8-15 colorful particles spawn on each tickle
- **Physics Simulation**: Particles have velocity, gravity, and life cycles
- **Dynamic Colors**: Random colors (yellow, orange, pink, cyan) for each particle
- **Realistic Movement**: Particles follow physics with gravity and fade out

### Facial Expression System
- **6 Unique Expressions**: Neutral, Happy, Laughing, Surprised, Sleepy, Excited
- **Dynamic Eyebrows**: Animated eyebrows that move with expressions
- **Cheek Highlights**: Pink cheek blush appears when laughing
- **Expression-Based Eye Spacing**: Eyes move closer/farther based on emotion
- **Mouth Variations**: 6 different mouth shapes for each expression
- **Snout Scaling**: Snout grows when surprised

### Environmental Lighting System
- **5 Lighting Modes**: Daylight ‚òÄÔ∏è, Sunset üåÖ, Night üåô, Party üéâ, Cozy üïØÔ∏è
- **Automatic Cycling**: Changes every 8 seconds with smooth transitions
- **Dynamic Bear Coloring**: Bear's fur adapts to environmental lighting
- **Background Tinting**: Subtle background color changes with lighting
- **Realistic Highlights**: Light reflections change based on environment

### Sound-Reactive Features
- **Visual Sound Response**: Bear scales up slightly with each sound
- **Expression Triggers**: Random facial expressions triggered by sounds
- **Multi-Sound Giggles**: Complex giggle patterns with multiple sounds
- **Expression-Specific Sounds**: Different sounds for different emotions

### Enhanced 3D Visuals
- **Multi-layered Gradients**: 3-4 color layers for realistic fur texture
- **Dynamic Shadows**: Shadows that move, resize, and blur with animations
- **Perspective Rotation**: 3D rotation effects on arms, legs, and ears
- **Depth-Based Highlights**: Strategic light reflections for 3D appearance
- **Eye Reflections**: Multiple shine points for lifelike eyes
- **Environmental Integration**: All elements respond to lighting changes

### Drag & Physics System
- **Smooth Dragging**: Bear follows finger with realistic physics
- **Position Memory**: Bear remembers where it was placed
- **Gesture Recognition**: Distinguishes between tickling and dragging
- **Boundary Awareness**: Bear can be moved anywhere on screen
- **Momentum**: Smooth transitions when releasing drag

Perfect for entertaining kids with an incredibly realistic, interactive 3D bear that feels alive! üêª‚ú®üéâ
